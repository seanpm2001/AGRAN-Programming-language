# GRANNY (Programming language)

GRANNY is an esotoric filter programming language. It was originally named AGRAN until 2022 August 3rd, when the project was renamed to have a better name. The repository name will remain the same.

GRANNY has syntax with elements of FORTRAN, Python, Java, Visual Basic Script, and HTML5. It is also implemented in these languages. As a filter language, it is designed to filter out keywords from programs that are deemed inappropriate.

It currently has the logo for the mobile game Angry Gran as its logo. This is a placeholder.

Old description:

## AGRAN-Programming-language
Another old draft for a programming language, as I love playing with languges and syntax, whether it be human-spoken, or computer generated. I don't know if I will continue this project.

## About

### Project Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AGRAN-Programming-language/Wiki/)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

### Syntax

GRANNY shares syntax with 5 languages:

- FORTRAN
- HTML5
- Java
- Python
- Visual Basic Script (VBS, not to be confused with VB.NET)

A demo program that filters out symbols illegal in Germany looks like this:

```fortran
progName = Androids.txt
program|start:
C: Start of script
D:--
ANDROIDS.TXT
ALGORITHM SOURCES
D:/end--<

android.output.printBox("Androids.txt")

D:--
android.output.printBox("Hello World!")
D:/end--<

{ Def Section badStuffRedAlert C: Flag as dangerous content
	C: BAD STUFF {RED ALERT}
	{ def HammerAndSickle
		☭ = Hammer and Sickle | contentStatus: [BAD] }
	{ def Swastika
		卍 = Swastika | contentStatus: [BAD] {
		RestrictIn State
		{ Germany ' No_more }
}
C: End of script
C: This is my web-based algorithm language called <currently unnamed>
end program|://terminate(Androids.txt);
```

This was the first program made with the language.

#### Hello World

The classic Hello World program in GRANNY.

```java
android.output.printBox("Hello World!")
```

#### Comments

##### Single line

Single line comments in GRANNY look like this:

```fortran
C: This is a single line comment in GRANNY
```

##### Multi-line

Multi-line (block) comments in GRANNY look like this:

```granny
D:--
This is a multi-line
comment in GRANNY
D:/end--<
```

Block comments are nestable.
